Project Scope:  
          Project Title:  Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning
          Purpose: 
          •	We can predict life expectancy of peoples in a country using machine learning with the help of this. In any country there are many factors that decrease the life of a person and also decreases the average life of peoples in any country like many people die from starvation, diseases etc. with machine learning we can predict their country’s life expectancy.
          •	When any country knew the factors that are decreasing the life expectancy of their people, they can try to reduce those factors and increase life expectancy.
